RadialMenu is a plug-and-play, data-driven radial menu system for Godot 4.x. It requires no autoloads or extra nodes—just drop it into your project and customize. RadialMenu supports both hard-coded and fully dynamic menu construction, making it suitable for rapid prototyping as well as production UI/UX.

HOW IT WORKS
============
[Explain how this is a two layer radial menu with 3 possible interaction states, and it's fluid feel]

Basic Hard-Coded Usage
======================
To quickly get started, you can create a menu by directly assigning a menu structure (a Dictionary) in your RadialMenuBus.gd script. The menu structure consists of categories, each with optional icons, descriptions, commands, and sub-items (for “outer ring” actions).

Example:
"var menu_construct_example: Dictionary = { 
	"meta_source": null,
	"menu_construct": {
		"[EDITOR EXAMPLE CATEGORY 0]": {
			"icon": ICON_PATH+"UI_TESTICON.png",
			"description": "Check The Documentation In The RadialMenu Folder",
			"command": "example_command",
			"meta_input": null,
		},
		"[EDITOR EXAMPLE CATEGORY 1]": {
			"icon": ICON_PATH+"UI_TESTICON.png",
			"description": "Check The Documentation In The RadialMenu Folder",
			"command": "example_command",
			"meta_input": null,
			"sub_items": {
				"[EDITOR EXAMPLE ActionA]": {
					"icon": ICON_PATH+"UI_TESTICON2.png",
					"description": "Check The Documentation In The RadialMenu Folder",
					"command": "example_command",
					"meta_input": null,
				},
				"[EDITOR EXAMPLE ActionB]": {
					"icon": ICON_PATH+"UI_TESTICON2.png",
					"description": "Check The Documentation In The RadialMenu Folder",
					"command": "example_command",
					"meta_input": null,
				},
			}
		}
	}
}

func example_command():
	print("THIS RUNS WHEN THE BUTTON WITH THIS COMMAND IS PRESSED.")

"
and then, for example, setting it like so:
	$RadialMenu.set_menu_construct(my_menu)


Hints and Tips
---------------
- Each “command” value in a menu construct dictionary, should be the name of a method on your MenuBus (see RadialMenuBus.gd).
- You can use icons, descriptions, and nested sub_items for rich, Two layered menus.
- Use the built-in example in the editor for a quick test or reference.

Advanced Usage (Procedural / Automated Menu Construction from Code)
===================================================================
RadialMenu is designed for full data-driven workflows. You can dynamically build or update your menu at runtime.
Ideal for games with unlockable abilities, context-sensitive actions, or editor tools.

You can also update or completely reconstruct the menu at any time by calling `set_menu_construct()` with a new dictionary.

Tips for Dynamic Usage:
-----------------------
- If you want to pass additional metadata to a command,
	add a `"meta_input"` key to your item,
	which corresponds to a valid reference in the meta_source
	at the top of your menu construct
	(like an array or a dictionary key index being the meta_input,
		and the array or dictionary itself being the meta_source)

- Use your own code to generate menu items based on the input source (meta source (dictionary or array) ),
	which can range from things like game state, inventory, player progress, etc.

- The menu will automatically update and reset its state, segments and sub-segments when you call `set_menu_construct()`.

- You can attach the RadialMenu to any node or position it anywhere on screen;
	its layout will adapt the position, but scaling must be accomodated in the parameters.


Notes & Tips
------------
- Do not use FontFile resources for text fields; use SystemFont OR FontVariation for proper text wrapping.
- The default editor example menu construct is safe for previewing and experimentation.
- All menu animation respects real-world time, unaffected by Engine.time_scale or Framerate.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If icons or fonts don't show, check that resource paths are correct.
- If you want to override commands or add new ones, edit or inherit `RadialMenuBus.gd`.
